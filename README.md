In this project, I analyzed a Pizza Hut store dataset to gain insights into orders, revenue, and customer preferences. I retrieved the total number of orders, calculated the total revenue from pizza sales, and identified key patterns like the most common pizza size and top pizza types based on orders and revenue. Through SQL queries, I also determined distribution patterns by time and category and explored the revenue contributions of different pizza types. My analysis included sorting and organizing the data for a clear, comprehensive view of pizza sales dynamics.
